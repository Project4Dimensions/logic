  This is a reverse chronological listing of my posts on <strong>Lingua
  Franca</strong>, a now discontinued group blog about language and
  writing in academe on the website of <i>The Chronicle of Higher
  Education</i>. My posts appeared on Lingua Franca once a week from
  August 2011 to December 2018. Unfortunately <i>The Chronicle</i> has
  now stashed all of my Lingua Franca posts behind a paywall; if you
  are not a signed-up subscriber you will be prompted to register with
  the site
  <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/">https://www.chronicle.com/</a>;
  this is free, but only gets the right to view 2 articles per month
  without a paid subscription.

<p align="justify" style="padding-left: 5.5rem; padding-right: 5.5rem;">
  You can email me (<b>pullum</b> at <b>gmail.com</b>) about any of the
  posts you have read, but note that they are now frozen: I cannot alter
  them, no matter what errors, falsehoods, or calumnies they might
  contain. They must stand in their present flawed form until perhaps I
  decide to republish them, or until the day of judgement arrives,
  whichever is the sooner.
