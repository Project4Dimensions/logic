<p>
  This is a reverse chronological listing of my posts on <strong>Lingua
  Franca</strong>, a blog about language and writing in academe that
  appeared every business day from August 2011 to December 2018 on the
  website of <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>. <em>The
  Chronicle</em> formerly maintained a
  <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/author/gpullum/">full
  archive</a> of Lingua Franca, but the link now seems to be <b>broken</b>;
  it goes to an "Oops!" page. Access to everything I have written for
  <em>The Chronicle</em> can be had by
  <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/search?q=%22Pullum%22">using their
  search function</a>, but there is a paywall preventing non-subscribers
  from getting access to any more than two articles per month.
</p>

<p>
  The list below is in reverse chronological order, and I think it is
  complete. (When I wrote "300 Up, Still Getting It Wrong", I thought it
  was post number 300, but there was a mistake in my records, and it was
  actually number 301. Embarrassing, but there it is . ) I’m grateful to
  <a href="https://github.com/Project4Dimensions/logic">Ludwig Jaffe</a>,
  who did some careful editing and checking of the list.
</p>

<p>
  You can email me (<b>pullum</b> at <b>gmail.com</b>) about any of
  these posts, but note that their original publication forms are now
  frozen in the web archive of <em>The Chronicle</em> for all eternity:
  I cannot correct or alter them no matter what errors or falsehoods
  they might contain.
