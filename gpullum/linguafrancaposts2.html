      This is a reverse chronological listing of my posts on
      <strong>Lingua Franca</strong>, a blog about language and writing
      in academe that appeared every business day from August 2011 to
      December 2018 on the website of <i>The Chronicle of Higher
      Education</i>. I think it's complete. (When I wrote ‘300 Up, Still
      Getting It Wrong’, I thought it was post number 300, but there was
      a mistake in my records, and I found later that it was actually
      numbered 301. Ironic.) I’m very grateful to
      <a href="https://github.com/Project4Dimensions/logic">Ludwig
      Jaffe</a>, who did some careful editing, checking, and reformatting
      of the list.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      Once upon a time <em>The Chronicle</em> maintained a
      <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/author/gpullum/">full
      archive</a> of all the Lingua Franca posts, but the link now seems
      to be broken: it just goes to a disappointing ‘Oops!’ page. Access
      to everything I have written for <em>The Chronicle</em> can in
      principle still be had by using 
      <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/search?q=%22Pullum%22">their
      search function</a>, but there is a paywall preventing
      non-subscribers from accessing any more than a stingy two articles
      per month.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      You can always email me (<b>pullum</b> at <b>gmail.com</b>) about
      any of these posts, but note that their original publication forms
      are now frozen in the web archive of <em>The Chronicle</em> for
      all eternity: I cannot correct or alter them no matter what errors
      or falsehoods they might contain.
